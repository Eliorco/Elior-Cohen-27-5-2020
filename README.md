Messaging Web Application
Full Stack Assignment using Flask as backend Vue as frontend
-----------------
clone the code and have a simple fullstack application to play with.

NOTE: in order to register user, use this example to send a curl request:
"""
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"first_name": "Chiko", "last_name":"Vediko", "password": "blublu123"}' http://localhost:5000/signup
"""
create this request only for flask server, Vue won't answer to that.
